<P>It is already mentioned that FD.Serialization library adds some metadata to serialized data gotten from a serializer. This metadata actually prepends serialized data, as described in the following table:</P>
<TABLE>
<THEAD>
<TR>
<TH width=104>Number of Bytes</TH>
<TH>Description</TH></TR></THEAD>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD width=104>1</TD>
<TD>
<P><STRONG><EM>Signing byte</EM></STRONG>. This single byte contains the following info:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Does metadata contain serializer ID byte or not. It is determined by the first bit from left in the signing byte (the most significant bit). If this bit is 1 it means that metadata contains serializer ID byte, and if it is 0 it means that it does not contain serializer ID byte. 
<LI>Does metadata contain type ID byte or not. It is determined by the second bit from left in the signing byte. 
<LI>Does metadata contain compressor byte or not. It is determined by the third bit from left in the signing byte. 
<LI>How many bytes are used for storing actual message length. It can be 0, 1, 2 or 4 bytes. This info is contained in the fourth and fifth bits in the signing byte. To remind you: actual serialized data length is written in metadata to provide so-called <EM>delimiting</EM>. FD.Serialization library will use minimal possible number of bytes to store this length. For example, if serialized data length is lesser than 256 bytes - FD.Serialization library will use only one byte to store this value; if serialized data length is lesser than 65536 - two bytes will be used; otherwise four bites will be used. </LI></UL>
<P>The last three bits from left in the signing byte are not used, and have to be set to 1.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=104>0 - N</TD>
<TD>
<P><STRONG><EM>Signing byte checking bytes</EM></STRONG>. These bytes (if configured) are used to confirm validity of signing byte explain above. This value is important if we are not sure that all the messages contain signing byte (thus contain metadata) or not. This is the case if not all messages are created by using FD.Serialization library, but some can be created by directly using particular serialization mechanism. If this is the case we cannot know for sure if particular message (i.e. byte array) contains signing byte or not. It is true that, thanks to the fact that signing byte has to have the last three bits set 1, we are able to rule-out some bytes (messages). But the risk that some message, although actually not being signing byte, may contain the first byte that ends with 3 bits by chance, its pretty huge, so we cannot rely only on this. For this reason we've introduced additional, so-called <EM>checking bytes</EM>. The number of checking bytes depends on configuration (<SPAN class=InlineCode>fd_serialization:signingByteCheckingLevel</SPAN> configuration value).</P>
<P>Signing byte checking works in the following way:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Library first checks if the first byte ends with three bits set to 1. If this is not the case it concludes that it is not a signing byte, and that the message does not contain metadata. 
<LI>After that library <EM>asks</EM> the first checking byte (by using some algorithm) "Can this first byte be a signing byte?" and gets yes/no answer. If the answer is no, the library concludes that it is not a signing byte, and that the message does not contain metadata. 
<LI>Previous step is repeated for every checking byte. 
<LI>If all checking bytes <EM>answer</EM> "yes" - library will assume that it is a signing byte, meaning that the message do contain metadata. </LI></UL>
<P>Few important notes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Obviously, signing byte checking mechanism is not absolutely accurate. No matter how many checking bytes we use, theoretically it may happen that some message without actual signing byte can have such data that it <EM>tricks</EM> this mechanism so that it concludes that signing byte is there. But, depending on number of checking bytes, it is very unlikely. Chance that single checking byte falsely <EM>answers</EM> "yes" is 1 / 256, which is still too big probability to rely on it. But if we use 4 checking bytes probability of falsely confirmed signing byte drops to (1 / 256) ^ 4, which is actually equal to probability to correctly guess single integer among all possible 32 bit integers, which is pretty small. In fact even .NET itself in <A href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.gethashcode.aspx" target=_blank>GetHashCode</A> method relies on expectation that such coincidence won't happen. For this reason we can pretty safely rely on 4 checking bytes. But if you want to be even more safe you can go with larger number of checking bytes. 
<LI>Keep in mind that <STRONG>checking bytes are needed only in solutions in which there are both message types</STRONG> (with and without signing byte). If you are using FD.Serialization across your solution, you can be sure that all messages do have signing byte, so you can set <SPAN class=InlineCode>fd_serialization:signingByteCheckingLevel</SPAN> to <SPAN class=InlineCode>0</SPAN>. </LI></UL></TD></TR>

Note that type ID section may or may not exist, and it is defined by the second bit from left in the signing byte, as described above. If type ID sequence does exist, it will have different length based on <SPAN class=InlineCode>fd_serialization:typeIdLength</SPAN> configuration value. Possible values are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Compressor ID (0 - 15), contained in the first four bits (from left) of this byte. This value defines which compressor (if any) is used for compressing the serialized data. 
<LI>Compressor option (0 - 15), contained in the last for bits (from left) of this byte. This value defines which compressor option is used (i.e. "Optimal", "Fast", etc.). </LI></UL></TD></TR>

<TD><STRONG><EM>Serialized data length</EM></STRONG>. This value defines how long actual serialized data is (X). Number of bytes of this section is determined by the fourth and fifth bits (from left) in the signing byte, as described above. If the number of bytes is 0 it means that metadata does not contain information about how long actual serialized data is (<EM>delimiting</EM> info is not included in the metadata). It may be the case if serialization mechanism used has embedded some kind of delimitation. For example BinaryFormatter serializer is capable to determine number of bytes to read automatically.</TD></TR>
